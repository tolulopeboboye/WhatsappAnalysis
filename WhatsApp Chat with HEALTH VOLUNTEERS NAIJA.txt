See how wonderfully God made you.
That U ponder my 💓 like potatoes, 
From the ink of my pen
The rhythms of my heart dance with the paper.
And dangle through the lines. 
Let the 🐦 s of the sky, sing their beautiful melody, for a beautiful creature was born this days years ago.

May the joy U brought to your family the U were born never cease. 
Happiness fills your day like water fills coconut.
I will stop here beautiful creature made by God, because my ink overflows 

Be blessed this day Amen

That calling out (a) child(ren's) name while they are sleeping can cause brain damage to the person.
Instead of calling their name, tap them gently and if they don't respond wait a bit and tap them later.
*Do not call out a person's name while they are sleeping* 
Because their adrenaline can shot up causing fear and panic which can cause *Brain Damage*

Greetings to everyone.

The season is a joyous one and today is significant because it's Christmas Day. It's a day to rejoice with family and friends, all and sundry especially for our Christian team members and family.

May this day be notable for blessings, love and joy in our families. 

I sincerely pray that we all have great news to share even in the remaining days of the year. May this come to fruition by the special grace of God.

I love us all and I'm happy to receive all the love from this family.

Have a great Christmas celebration 

Thank You.

*Popcorn
*Pepper soup
*Drinks

09/01/2020

Good morning Leaders and great Nigerians!

I am glad to be here. It's examination period here in Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta, so I have decided to give it a full focus. 

I submit all and total respect to everybody here, starting from the Executive director of HVN (Sijuade Akinyemi Eshilokun) and all portfolios. I extend my greetings to my colleague and HVN Secretary of Ogun State (Solate Hakeemah Akaanke). Please pardon me as I once again further my greetings to all amiable personalities here without mentions, sooner we will get to know every faces. 

After the aforesaid exam ongoing, I have planned to meet with my able secretary (Solate Hakeemah) with a view to making plans for the works ahead of 2020 and harness more Ogun hub executives. More volunteers have been disturbing to be part of the movement though, in which I have told them to save the strength till after the raging exam. 

I would like to implore all HVN Volunteers nationwide to please do more for humanity with the mindset of making the environment sustainable and conducive to live. We can only do our best, but sometimes when our best is not good enough, we've got to continue striving until it is achieved. 

With all sincerity and enthusiasm, I love this movement and everyone here. I want to really thank you for what you do and how you've stand tall to militating health challenges facing the populace. 

Have a wonderful day ahead as I relieved my hand from the android screen. 

Thank you!

Ogunkayode, Kabiru Olaitan

1/12/20, 9:33 PM - +234 806 094 3206: *"Tips on how to retrieve your money after you have been scammed".* 
👇
1. Screenshot all previous chats across all messaging app (IG and WhatsApp or FB).

2. Write out the Full name and account number of the page or person.

3. Go to the last notification your bank sent you after you made the payment (via mobile app or text) copy out the "TRANSACTION ID NUMBER".

4. Go to any branch of the scam artist's bank (the bank the scammer uses), ask to see the CUSTOMER SERVICE in charge of FRAUD.

5. If you can, print out all those chats with the scammer, and submit it. While you are there, send an email to SCAMMER'S BANK and copy CBN FRAUD DESK (anticorruptionunit@cenbank.org) . this will ginger the bank to take it up fast.

What should you expect from this?

 The suspect's account will be PLACED ON HOLD. Meaning he/she cannot transfer or withdraw until they visit the bank, and when they do, the bank will contact the police and the suspect when proven guilty will sign a waiver allowing the bank to refund your money.

Good Morning all, 

This information has become necessary as we have opened our doors for massive recruitment in the past 2 months. 

One of our Sustainable means of Income is from direct contribution of members. For start up funding for our projects, we have a Monthly Due of ₦1,000 which we encourage our members to pay. The record for this is being kept with the Treasurer @2347065548316.

Persons who want to pay for more than a month at once are free to do so and this is encouraged too. 

Please do bear with us as Finance is Key to sustainability. 

Best Regards

Good Day Family,

My name is Sijuade and I have an information and request  for you. Yes, YOU!

Do you have household items, clothes, shoes, bags children toys and all that are still in good condition but you are not using? Please donate them is support of our  Charity Yard Sales holding in Èbúté Metta this February. Persons who genuinely need them will get it at the event.

Are you willing to commit a token to charity this year? Do you know that you can clothe a person with as low as #500? With #500, you can buy quality, durable clothes and other items for people who genuinely need them. 

This Charity Yard Sale is immensely beneficial as it will provide funds for a targeted Community health outreach within Èbúté Metta Community. 

Can you imagine how your #500 can make so much impact by clothing one person and providing healthcare for another. Just #500 !

Send me a message or call the number on the flier to donate cash or drop off items.

Let's do charity today!

Best Regards

1/16/20, 6:54 PM - +234 802 694 7473: *HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES*

Good Evening All,

It has been a long, sad moment in here since we were notified of the passing away of the mother of one of our PROs, Mrs Onyeneke yesterday.

Dear Jane @2348080976617 On behalf of the entire HVN  family, permit me to express our condolences on this sad occurrence. We pray that God the Almighty grants her soul eternal rest, forgive her shortcomings and make her one of the dwellers of Paradise. May He also grant the family grace to bear the loss.

On this note, it is sad to communicate the *postponement* of our earlier scheduled training which was to take place tonight. It will now take place on Sunday 8pm. This is in honor of our dearest departed mummy. Sincere apologies to the Media team who have put in a great effort in preparation for tonight's training.

This is indeed a down time. Take heart dear. 

Thanks Family for the support that we give ourselves in here.

Regards

1/17/20, 7:45 PM - +234 816 064 1402: Today i watched a documentary on AIT 8pm News about a community called Nuku in Abaji area council in FCT. The documentary was on how the people there has resulted to self medication because the only health care center in their community is non functional.

I could imagine the rate and level of health issues that will be in that community. 
I want to suggest if we can carry out a medical outreach there. We could focus on basic health checks like malaria, hepatitis b, sugar level, RVS and it's likes

Thank you guys.
1/19/20, 8:10 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Theory of Change is a process to identify, analyse and solve problems as well as how to improve and adapt your objectives to societal changes.
The essence of theory of change is to make us understand that the measures we used to attain a position is not the same measure that will help us attain another.
Basically, its not what gets you here that will get you there.
1/19/20, 8:11 PM - +234 813 122 9553: So when we talk about creating change, we need a set of techniques that will guide the process of making impact.
1/19/20, 8:12 PM - +234 813 122 9553: The theory of change helps us to think through, articulate and follow up with our aims, objectives and ideas.
It’s the process of creating a change, determine input and intended outcomes, the activities expected to implement/achieve the outcomes.
What theory of change will help us achieve is strategic planning, effective communication, critical thinking, and clear understanding of a project.
1/19/20, 8:12 PM - +234 903 191 7748: Hy
1/19/20, 8:14 PM - +234 813 122 9553: The PCCSS+S model is used to explain the process in Theory of Change.

P: PROBLEM
What is the basic problem your organisation is trying to solve?
It’s not just about the problem.
It’s about why you want to solve the problem as a person or as a group in a organization....
Where are the places you seek change?
What do you want your organization to be known for?
1/19/20, 8:19 PM - +234 802 694 7473: ✍🏼
1/19/20, 8:19 PM - +234 813 122 9553: With this we can figure the rest of the elements

So,
In context to our organisations, we want to have an inclusive health system especially in underserved communities.
1/19/20, 8:19 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Right?
1/19/20, 8:20 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Exactly
1/19/20, 8:20 PM - +234 808 097 6617: Yeah
1/19/20, 8:20 PM - +234 909 856 6396: Yes
1/19/20, 8:20 PM - +234 813 122 9553: For the purpose of this session, lets make do with a problem to aid our understanding.
What shall we focus on?
1/19/20, 8:21 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Someone should suggest an issue
1/19/20, 8:22 PM - +234 803 531 8410: Stress
1/19/20, 8:23 PM - +234 813 122 9553: We will go with stress....
So what is the problem with stress?
What are the causes, and health implications
1/19/20, 8:24 PM - +234 813 122 9553: That's the problem we are trying to solve
1/19/20, 8:24 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Outbreak of Cholera in Badagry
1/19/20, 8:24 PM - +234 815 509 2755: ☝🏾
1/19/20, 8:25 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Okay
1/19/20, 8:25 PM - +234 803 531 8410: This message was deleted
1/19/20, 8:26 PM - +234 815 509 2755: Causes, overthinking.
Health implications Stroke, high blood pressure
1/19/20, 8:26 PM - +234 813 122 9553: We can make do with any problem. It's just to aid our understanding of the PCCSS+S- model
1/19/20, 8:26 PM - +234 815 509 2755: Stress can be caused when u overwork your body
1/19/20, 8:27 PM - +234 815 509 2755: Aha!
1/19/20, 8:27 PM - +234 808 097 6617: Health implications: Severe headache,restlessness
1/19/20, 8:27 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Great... So this is the problem we want to deal with.
Stress causes stroke, high BP, diabetes, asthma, heart disease
Restlessness etc...
This is huge!
1/19/20, 8:28 PM - +234 703 312 5473: 👍🏽

C: WHAT WILL CHANGE LOOK LIKE
Here you picture what change will look like after you solve the problem. You are also to make sure to set timeline for this change you desire.

What will change look like includes what we want and many more depending on the nature of the environment.
1/19/20, 8:30 PM - +234 813 122 9553: So when we say the problem is stress and we want to see change....what are the changes we want to see
1/19/20, 8:31 PM - +234 808 097 6617: Relaxing
1/19/20, 8:31 PM - +234 813 122 9553: For me, I would say
A healthy work environment
Eating healthy
1/19/20, 8:32 PM - +234 909 856 6396: Sigh of relief. 
Chubby cheeks 🥰
Healthy diet
1/19/20, 8:32 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Yes...  Meditation and exercise
1/19/20, 8:32 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Yes...
1/19/20, 8:32 PM - +234 808 097 6617: A prescribed medication not self medication
1/19/20, 8:33 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Thank you
1/19/20, 8:35 PM - +234 813 122 9553: But one thing we need to consider when we talk about impact and change is that
The project must be realistic
The assessment should be timed

So to talk about the change we want to see, we need to figure which geographical location to focus on, timeline of our project as well of have a monitoring and evaluation plan
1/19/20, 8:36 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Apy

Time bound.

This way we are not making bogus, ambiguous and unrealistic goals/objectives
1/19/20, 8:38 PM - +234 802 694 7473: ✍🏼
1/19/20, 8:38 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Are we clear so far?
1/19/20, 8:39 PM - +234 909 856 6396: 💝

1/19/20, 8:40 PM - +234 813 122 9553: The next C!

C: HOW WILL THE CHANGE HAPPEN
Here, 
Think about processes that will aid in creating that change 
Think about what will go into creating that change
1/19/20, 8:41 PM - +234 813 122 9553: After we must have considered what makes our project realistic, doable and sustainable.
We can now generate ideas as to achieving the outcomes...
1/19/20, 8:42 PM - +234 813 122 9553: We know what change will look like...
Relief
Healthy lifestyle
No drug misuse
Chubby cheeks
Healthy work environment....

How do we achieve these
1/19/20, 8:42 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Very very important
1/19/20, 8:43 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Public enlightenment on causes and risk factors
1/19/20, 8:44 PM - +234 808 097 6617: Medical outreach and awareness
1/19/20, 8:44 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Encouraging regular exercising and rest
1/19/20, 8:44 PM - +234 813 122 9553: You guys are spot on!
1/19/20, 8:45 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Endearing businesses to give cognizance to their employees wellbeing
1/19/20, 8:46 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Advocacy to government to improve on health service
1/19/20, 8:48 PM - +234 813 122 9553: This will take us to our next factor :


S: SUCCESS FACTOR
Here, we think about human and material resources that we will need (e.g. govt, corporate business, collaboration with similar Org., community etc)
1/19/20, 8:49 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Of course, we know the essence of partnering and collaborating...
The importance of reaching out for help in order to achieve our goals....

We need funds, support, people
1/19/20, 8:50 PM - +234 813 122 9553: These includes
volunteers,
 friends,
pharmaceutical companies

Health institutions, ministry etc.

Partner/similar organizations - collaboration

Corporate business
1/19/20, 8:51 PM - +234 813 122 9553: These material and human resources are needed to ensure that we solve this problem
1/19/20, 8:52 PM - +234 815 920 8044: Please keep it coming. I'm still at work. I will read them later thanks
1/19/20, 8:53 PM - +234 813 122 9553: So if we are to organize a medical  outreach to sensitize and make people aware of the health implications of stress and how they live healthy and stress free?

Who and what do we need?
1/19/20, 8:54 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Are we still here?
1/19/20, 8:55 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Here
1/19/20, 8:58 PM - +234 802 694 7473: The community associations, media houses,  drugs and pharmaceutical companies, volunteers
1/19/20, 9:00 PM - +234 813 122 9553: So we agree that these are our success factors because HVN cant just appear and start talking to the air 😂
1/19/20, 9:01 PM - +234 813 122 9553: The next stage is a continuation of our success factors.... 

The S+
Spheres of accountability within....
1/19/20, 9:01 PM - +234 802 694 7473: 🤣
1/19/20, 9:03 PM - +234 909 856 6396: True
1/19/20, 9:04 PM - +234 813 122 9553: These are stakeholder needed for our implementation....
In this case, we need to establish and manage relationships...
Identify where they belong, know their strengths and capabilities
Identifying our success factors will help us identify those who are working for similar outcomes,
Those who might positively /negatively influence our project 
Collaborate
1/19/20, 9:06 PM - +234 813 122 9553: So if we take a cue from our success factors, we will see that these people are also our stakeholders
1/19/20, 9:07 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Can we identify the stakeholders we can easily influence and be sure we can always get them to help us achieve our aim
1/19/20, 9:07 PM - +234 802 694 7473: ✍🏼✍🏼
1/19/20, 9:10 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Where are we....
1/19/20, 9:10 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Sure.... pharmaceutical companies, media, volunteers, core team members, partners, board of trustee members
1/19/20, 9:11 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Hmmm.....
Pharmaceutical companies...
Please give me reasons
1/19/20, 9:12 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Please guys, HVN does not belong to the E.D.
Let's come back 😭
1/19/20, 9:12 PM - +234 813 122 9553: We are almost done
1/19/20, 9:14 PM - +234 802 694 7473: The pharmaceutical companies can always support our programs with drugs from their stores to help with case management. Since this is readily available for them, they may have little or no difficulty working with the organization
1/19/20, 9:15 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Where una dey?
1/19/20, 9:15 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Okay...
I will like to take the "Little" as a clause we need to determine
1/19/20, 9:16 PM - +234 813 122 9553: So basically, we know the people we can influence from the S+
1/19/20, 9:16 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Yea
1/19/20, 9:19 PM - +234 813 122 9553: This takes us to the last item
S-

S-: Spheres of accountability without 
stakeholders that we do not have control over. (govt, intl org. etc)

The stakeholders we cannot control or easily influence
1/19/20, 9:21 PM - +234 810 650 5698: Here
1/19/20, 9:23 PM - +234 802 694 7473: These stakeholders cannot be controlled really
1/19/20, 9:23 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Who are they?
1/19/20, 9:23 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Still taking a cue from the success factors... The human resources
1/19/20, 9:25 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Government and it's agencies, partnering organizations e.g companies
1/19/20, 9:25 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Absolutely
1/19/20, 9:26 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Dealing with these stakeholders takes a lot of patience, advocacy and constant follow up
1/19/20, 9:27 PM - +234 813 122 9553: The reason I asked questions about pharmaceutical is because they can also be out of our control in the cases where they dont feel like they should play their social responsibilities
1/19/20, 9:28 PM - +234 813 122 9553: What this means is that we can have some stakeholders who falls within and outside our control...
This is because human behavior is unpredictable
1/19/20, 9:29 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Even our volunteers, the community we want to impact might be reluctant to come on board
1/19/20, 9:29 PM - +234 813 122 9553: It's human psychology...
That's why from the beginning I mentioned that theory of Change also means being able to adapt to societal changes....
Tailoring your goals and strategies to suit the environment in which you plan to operate in
1/19/20, 9:30 PM - +234 810 650 5698: Very correct
1/19/20, 9:31 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Conclusively, theory of change will make outline our plans, helps us make smart strategies and help us with the appropriate method of measuring impact.

It’s not enough to have plans or wish for things to happen
1/19/20, 9:32 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Thank you guys for being here with me.
We have come to the end of the session.

Let me know if you have any questions?
1/19/20, 9:33 PM - +234 803 531 8410: Thanks for the lecture
1/19/20, 9:33 PM - +234 810 650 5698: Thank you ma
1/19/20, 9:33 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Thanks so much
1/19/20, 9:33 PM - +234 802 694 7473: I have a question
1/19/20, 9:34 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Yes please
1/19/20, 9:35 PM - +234 802 694 7473: How can one can analyse a project's risks and success, evaluate a project or measure impact along this chain
1/19/20, 9:41 PM - +234 813 122 9553: Firstly, how can one analyse a project risk
Here we need to have an outline of possible problems, obstacles that serves as hindrances to a project... 
The best way to Analyse project's risks to understand and take into  the following factors :
Cost implications
Stakeholders within and outside
Safety precautions
Visibility of project : timeline
1/19/20, 9:43 PM - +234 813 122 9553: When considering these factors and the associated risk.... It is important to come up with a risk management plan to mitigate some of these problems.

Do not forget that when you analyze your risk,
It might mean that you need to restrategize, or even consider doing or not doing the proposed project depending on the level of risk management techniques
1/19/20, 9:43 PM - +234 802 694 7473: ✍🏼✍🏼✍🏼
1/19/20, 9:43 PM - +234 802 694 7473: ✍🏼
1/19/20, 9:47 PM - +234 813 122 9553: On evaluating and measuring impact....

The first thing to take into consideration before embarking on a project is to always take cognizance of the environment.... Do they need what you are bringing to them or its just what you deem right for them..
It's not a bad idea to say, these people need this and you want to do it.... But leadership is not about you..... It's about your followers, your beneficiaries....

This is the first step to measuring impact/success....
Identify the needs of the beneficiaries
Doing proper follow up on progress of you project.

Personally, I like when a project is being repeated in a community for 3 to 5 times....
You can measure your impact over these period....
See if this community is now healthier than the last two outreaches
1/19/20, 9:49 PM - +234 802 694 7473: Thank you for this information. It's good to have learnt from your wealth of experience.

1/21/20, 10:31 AM - +234 803 917 6755: Central Bank Of Nigeria Have Finally Signed The Currency Swap Deal.
opera.comJan 14, 2020 12:58 PM
*CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA HAVE FINALLY SIGNED THE CURRENCY SWAP DEAL*



*IT'S WORTH! READING...*

*IN CASE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.*

 I know Most of You don't know the meaning of Nigeria dollars, yuan swap with China.. And why American government is desperately smoothing the relationship with Nigeria.

 Soon you will be buying that techno phone you bought at N80,000 for N12,000.

 The Central Bank of Nigeria have finally signed the currency swap deal we have been expecting for the past 2 years into existence with the Chinese government.

 The importance of this is that since almost 70% of the goods we import come from China and Asia and 12% America why must we use Dollars to transact with China? from now instead of using dollars at N350 to 1dollar to import those goods, we can now buy Yuan at 47 naira to 1 Yuan and import those stuffs directly.

 Instead of buying these goods in dollars in China, we will now buy them in Yuan which is 5times cheaper than dollars.

 A giant stride against Nigerian looters who will not want it to be reported or allow end-users to understand this victory over supremacy of dollars in our daily lives and economic activities.

 Up coming reality is that from tomorrow, try to monitor exchange rate. Some of those guys who hoarded foreign currencies to make gains will off load them in order not to have heart attack over their huge loss arising from the currency swap deal with china. 

Dollars and pounds will flood everywhere with no buyers, as the buyers will draw naira from their accounts in banks with presence in China. 

Many NIGERIAN banks will be seeking to have their representative office in China like first bank saw to the future and already have office in China. 

Inflation will go down drastically because of the price of commodities that will drop.

*SHARE AND ENLIGHTEN OUR PEOPLE, THIS IS A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT

MINISTRY OF HEALTH

PRESS RELEASE
NOVEL CORONAVIRUS: LAGOS ALERTS PUBLIC
•	No cases of the virus have been identified in Lagos State or Nigeria
•	Lagos ramping up its level of preparedness
•	Collaborating with the Federal Ports Authority on Screening and Surveillance
•	Advise Citizens on Precautionary Measures against contagious infections 
The Lagos State Government has alerted the public to a new virus, the novel Coronavirus (nCoV) which is currently raging in China and have been reported some countries of the world including United States of America and have caused no fewer than nine deaths.

The State Government through a press statement issued by the Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi said Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). 

Abayomi explained that the novel Coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans adding that Coronaviruses are primarily infections of animals that can be transmitted to humans.  

“On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO), China Country Office was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. A novel Coronavirus was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on the 7th January”

“As of 22nd January 2020, a total of 471 cases have been confirmed in South East Asia and USA with 9 deaths. There is evidence now that the infection is able to spread from person to person”, the Commissioner said. 

He disclosed that the common signs and symptoms of the infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing adding that in more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. 

While noting that no cases of the virus have been identified in Lagos, Nigeria or anywhere in Africa, the Commissioner stated that the State Lagos is ramping up its level of preparedness considering the large commercial trading traffic between Nigeria and China and Thailand. 

“The Lagos State Biosecurity team in collaboration with Lagos University Teaching Hospital is currently working on building urgent capacity to identify the virus in our Biosecurity facility and isolation wards located at the Mainland Infectious Disease Hospital in Yaba in the event of any suspected case arriving in Lagos State”

“We are in touch with Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) in Abuja to align our strategies. Importantly we are also collaborating with the Federal Ports Authority at air, land and sea border posts to elevate screening and surveillance of incoming travelers”, he said

1/24/20, 12:07 AM - +234 803 917 6755: *Ile aiye, ile asan, Omule mofo  ( LIFE)* 

A woman died recently. She was a widow. She also had no child. She died in her late 50s. She has been buried.

When the family went to clean her property, they were amazed. She was a hoarder. The type you watch on American and British reality shows. She had stuffs filling her apartment. 
Piles of new materials. 
Piles of expired food products. 
Piles of gifts and souvenirs dating 10 years. 
6 television sets. 
5 new freezers. 
4 new generating sets. 
New gas cookers. 
Kerosine stoves of the 80s. 
All new.  
Expired vegetable oil. 
Decaying bags of rice. 
And so forth. 
There was no sitting space in a 4 bedroom apartment. 
Littered with junk.  

Plenty of stuff was thrown away. Many shared by family members who had no clue on how she lived. I am certain she has  a decent amount in the bank. She was prudent. Almost much too prudent. Bordering on...

Many of us are like her. We can’t give away stuff that we do not need. We pile “junk” that might be useful to another. We have clothes in wardrobes all over. We hoard everything we own. Lace of 92, gele of 88. 

Many even hoard love and praise. They hoard affection. No one is deserving of love. No one is deserving of help. When they lose one they love, they cry, because they hoarded words of affection and more. 

Life is meant to be lived. That we will die is certain. The uncertainty is when and how. The wise one lives everyday as the last. 

This is not to be read as encouraging wastage. Or failing to save for tomorrow. 

Empty your barns regularly to the needy so you also can have new.

At the end, the only thing you take with you, is how well you impacted the lives of others and your relationship with God, Nourish that..........

AND DON'T HOARD THIS POST TOO 😁

Good Morning all, do engage our Monday Motivation Message on IG and follow the account if you're not doing that already.

Unfortunately, in Naija today, it's  #LassaFever Monday. A fresh case was confirmed at FMC, Abeokuta yesterday. What if some of his close contacts have been to Lagos or other states in the past 2-3 days? The risk continues to get increased. Harm yourself with information ND stay woke!

1/29/20, 10:16 AM - +234 807 753 8091: Types of Physical Activities


Before you start planning a routine of regular physical activities for yourself, take some time to learn more about the variety of physical activities that you can engage in.

​When engaging in regular physical activity or planning your physical activity routine, it is important for you to know the types of physical activity that you should engage in and the benefits they provide:

Aerobic activity makes you breathe harder and your heart beat faster, as a result, increases heart and lung fitness. Examples include brisk walking, dancing, cycling, jogging, swimming and playing basketball.

Muscle-strengthening activity increase bone strength and muscular fitness. Such activities should work all the major muscle groups of your body, that is, the legs, hips, back, chest, abdomen, shoulders and arms. Examples include doing exercises that use your body weight for resistance (e.g. push ups, pull ups, sit ups and squats), working with resistance band and weight training.

How much aerobic activity do I need?

To gain health benefits, it is recommended that a healthy adult engages in either:

150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week, or 
More than 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity a week.​

The good news is that you can combine moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity in a week for more variety.

Do the aerobic activity in segments of at least 10 minutes. You don't have to do the 20 or 30 minutes at one go.
Measuring intensity
Intensity is how hard your body is working during aerobic activity. Let's take a look at the difference between moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity activities.

Moderate-intensity aerobic activity
Moderate-intensity aerobic activity causes a slight increase in breathing and heart rate. However, you are still able to talk but not sing during the activity. You should also be perspiring. Examples include:

Brisk walking (5 km/hr)
Leisure cycling (<16 km/hr)
Leisure swimming
Playing doubles tennis
Line-dancing
Vigorous-intensity aerobic activity
Vigorous-intensity aerobic activity causes your heart rate to increase significantly.
You are breathing hard and fast and you will find it difficult to hold a conversation with someone.
Examples of vigorous-intensity physical activity include:

Jogging or running
Swimming continuous laps
Playing singles tennis
Rollerblading at fast pace
Playing basketball or football
Skipping with the ropes.

I am delighted to welcome you all to the beautiful month of February, the *original* season of 💞 😁

A special welcome to volunteers that joined us recently, we are glad to have you with us on this journey of impact. 

Just one month into the new year and to the glory of God and your contributions we have made tangible progress. In January;

1. We increased our reach by activating HVN in two states, Ogun and Oyo respectively. 

2. We were consistent with our online campaign *"stop the scourge"* which was in partnership with Dr. Blessed Oromona to raise awareness about sickle cell disease. We also participated in the physical outreach that was held in Sokoto.

3. We had an in-house training/ capacity building session on *the theory of change* which was handled by our very own organizing secretary, Omotoyosi Idris @2348131229553 

4. Finally, we had our first physical meeting of the year to strategize.

All of these was made possible because of you. Thank you for your commitment. Let's do better this month💪🏾💪🏾

2/3/20, 11:11 AM - +234 802 694 7473: MONDAY MOTIVATION ON HVNAIJA

You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream. - C.S. Lewis

We often limit ourselves by making conclusions that some dreams are not achievable or that our age is a limiting factor. This is only a FALSE idea and in itself, a limiting factor.

We derive our Monday Motivation from Stan Lee

At 95 years old, Stan Lee is considered the godfather of Marvel comics. However, he didn’t create his first comic until he was 39.

At nearly 40, Lee created the first The Fantastic Four comic, which later led to him co-creating Spider-Man, Black Panther, the X-Men and countless other legendary superheroes who now dominate the box office decades later.

Your age will not limit you, Dream big, leave your comfort zone and go pursue your dream today!
